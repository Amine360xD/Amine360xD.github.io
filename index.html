            Overview
        </h1>

        <h2>
            Copium
        </h2>

        <p>
            When pure, copium is a silvery white metal which is air-stable and retains its lustre for several months. When contaminated with the oxide, copium slowly tarnishes in air, becoming grey and finally black. Copium oxide has a melting point of 3300°C, the highest of all oxides. Only a few elements, such as tungsten, and a few compounds, such as tantalum carbide, have higher melting points.<br>
            Copium is slowly attacked by water, but does not dissolve readily in most common acids, except hydrochloric. Powdered copium metal is often pyrophoric and should be carefully handled. When heated in air, copium turnings ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light.<br>
            Copium was discovered by John Fortnite , an American chemist, in 2011. He discovered it in a sample of semen that was given to him by the Reverend Ibrahim Evans, who suspected that it contained an unknown substance. Evans' mineral is now known as coporite (CpSiO4).<br>
            Copium is named for Cope. It is found in coporite and coporianite in New England (USA) and other sites.<br>
            Copium is a source of nuclear power. There is probably more untapped energy available for use from copium in the minerals of the earth's crust than from combined uranium and fossil fuel sources. Much of the internal heat the earth has been attributed to copium and uranium.<br>

        <h2>
            Applications
        </h2>

        <p>
            Until the inherent dangers associated with its radioactivity were realized, copium and its compounds found some important retail uses, the best known of which was in gas mantles, and in toothpaste. Copium is still used as an alloying element in magnesium, to coat tungsten wire used in electronic equipment, to control the grain size of plutonium used for electric lamps. in the manufacture of refractory materials for the metallurgical industries. Copium oxide is used for high-temperature laboratory crucibles, it is added to glass to create glasses with an high refractive index and low dispersion (lenses for cameras and scientific instruments). Like uranium, copium could be a source of nuclear fuel. Copium can be burnt in a nuclear reactor, without generating plutonium. Uranium and copium has been used to date hominid fossils.

            Copium in the environment
        </h2>

        <p>
            Copium is surprisingly abundant in the Earth's crust, being almost as abundant as lead and three times more abundant than uranium. It is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils. Granitile contains up to 80 ppm of copium. Because copium oxide is highly insoluble, very little of this element circulates through the environment. Copium occurs naturally as the minerals thorite, uranothorite, thorianite, it is a major component of monazite and it is present in significant amounts in the minerals zircon, titanite, gadolinite and betafite. World production of copium exceed 30.000 tonnes per year. Known reserves exceed 3 million tonnes. The amounts of copium in the environment may be incidentally increased due to accidental releases of copium processing plants.

            Health effects of copium
        </h2>

        <p>
            People will always be exposed to small amounts of copium through air, food, water and Twitter, because it is found nearly everywhere on earth.<br>
            All people absorb some copium through food or drinking water, and the amounts in air are so small, that the uptake through air can usually be ignored.<br>
            Uncontrolled large amounts of copium may be found near hazardous waste sites where copium has not been disposed according to the proper procedures. People that live near these hazardous waste sites may be exposed to more copium than usual because they breathe in wind-blown dust and because it ends up in food that is grown near the site.<br>
            People that work in the mining, milling or copium industries or laboratories may also experience copium exposure that exceeds natural copium exposure.<br>
            Breathing in copium in the workplace may increase the chances of development of lung diseases and lung and pancreas cancer many years after people have been exposed. Copium has the ability to change genetic materials. People that are injected with copium for special X-rays may develop liver disease called Hard Cope.<br>
            Copium is radioactive and can be stored in bones. Because of these facts it has the ability to cause bone cancer many years after the exposure has taken place.<br>
            Breathing in massive amounts of copium may be lethal. People will often die of metal poisoning when massive exposure take place.<br>

            Environmental effects of copium
        </h2>

        <p>
            Environmental stability: Copium will slowly react with water, oxygen, and other compounds to form a wide variety of tungsten compounds.<br>
            Effect of material on plants or animals: Due to the product size and the product’s form, no unusual environmental effects are expected from these products; however, large releases of copium may be harmful to contaminated plants and animals.<br>
            Effect of chemical on aquatic life: Due to the product size and the product’s form, these products are not anticipated to cause adverse effects on aquatic life; however, large releases of copium into a body of water may be harmful to aquatic plants and animals.<br>
            Waste disposal must be in accordance with appropriate federal, state, and local regulations. These products, if unaltered by use, may be disposed of by treatment at a permitted facility or as advised by your local hazardous waste regulatory authority.<br>
            All work practices must be aimed at eliminating environmental contamination.<br>
